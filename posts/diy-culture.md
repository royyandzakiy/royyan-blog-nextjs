Do It Yourself, also known as DIY has evolved from making small projects such as making small decorative items using paper and other stationaries, into a literally making a nuclear reactor at one's garage. It has developed and matured through out history usually from small communities, driven purely by interest. It has thriven best in these past early years through the ability to share what they have made, and creating a particularly democratized community through free social medias such as youtube (yes, it is classified as a social media), instagram, discord servers, and much more.

It is truly a great time to live in, for the time has come where one can almost literally learn to do anything, and learn from anyone all around the world. The DIY Culture perhaps will keep on living some other time and probably will not die off anytime soon.
