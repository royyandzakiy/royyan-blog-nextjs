I always think that leadership really is the essential core to building startups in Indonesia. Sometimes we just couldn't expect to have that High level of competence through out the early stages of a company or let's say a startup. Therefore leadership is very important, as it basically is the ultimate force that keeps the organization intact and on track.

But, in many occasions, the impairment of the Indonesia startup leaders, or perhaps the middle management -leaders- are not really capable of leading. Such incapabilities may vary, from the lack of vision, having low self esteem and being paranoidic, until just purely not knowing what he/she is doing.
